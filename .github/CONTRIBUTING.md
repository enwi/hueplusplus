# Contribution Guide
Help is always welcome. If you want to contribute to hueplusplus, please read these guidelines

## Request feature / Report bug
To request a feature or report a bug, create an issue using the templates.

## Making changes
If you want to add a new feature or fix a bug, first check out the development branch.
Maybe the feature already exists and you would just do duplicate work.

Also use the development branch as the base for your feature branch, because all pull requests are first rebased into development.

## Pull requests
When creating a pull request, be sure to choose development as the target.
You might need to rebase on development again and merge in new changes.

## Code style
The code is formatted using clang-format. If you do not want to use it yourself, try to keep your style consistent with the other code
so not too many reformats are necessary.
